# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for AI-Powered Note Management app

Act as a senior software engineer specializing in Python development and web development.

Write a detailed plan/spec for a production ready app I want to build. Then it uses AI to summarize each of them and can use relevance search to help me search through all of the stored.
Write this in `docs` folder the format of a PRD using .md file format.
Then come up with a step by step todo list to build this out in .md format in the same folder.
