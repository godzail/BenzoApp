# Improve Prompt Clarity and Effectiveness

## Description

Improve the clarity and effectiveness of existing prompts by refining language, ensuring alignment with intended goals, and adding necessary details while maintaining the original purpose.

## Steps

1. Analyze the existing prompt to understand its main objective and expected outcomes.
2. Identify areas where clarity or detail is missing.
3. Refine the language for clear and concise communication.
4. Ensure the prompt aligns closely with the intended goal and expected output.
5. Add examples or additional instructions if they enhance understanding or effectiveness.

## Output Format

Provide a rewritten prompt that includes all necessary elements for effective task completion, maintaining the original's intent but with improved clarity and guidance.

## Example

**Original Prompt:** "Write a summary of the article."

**Improved Prompt:** "Summarize the key points and conclusions of the provided article in no more than three paragraphs, focusing on main arguments and supporting evidence."

## Notes

- Be cautious not to alter the original intent or requirements of the prompt unless clarity demands it.
- Include placeholders [like this] where user-specific input prompt elements are needed.
